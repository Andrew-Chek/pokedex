# Pokedex

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. This command loads all dependencies and builds app at localhost:4200.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. This command allows you to optimize the code and put all the logic of the app into a few files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma]. As you can see, all components, pipe and service were covered with unit tests.

## Github pages

App is available via link https://andrew-chek.github.io/pokedex/. There you can see the website without loading it locally
